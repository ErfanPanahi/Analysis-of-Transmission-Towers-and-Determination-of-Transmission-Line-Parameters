# Analysis-of-Transmission-Towers-and-Determination-of-Transmission-Line-Parameters
In this project, we intend to examine various towers constructed for power transmission purposes and, considering simplifying assumptions, obtain the parameters of the transmission lines that are placed on these towers.

The voltage levels of the transmission network are 230 kV and 400 kV. For each voltage level in the transmission network, we consider a tower commonly used throughout the national grid and determine the unit length parameters. Then, we construct a network consisting of 230 kV and 400 kV voltage levels and use the values obtained from the first section for the transmission line parameters in this network. Subsequently, we encounter several challenges related to operating a power network, and we strive to solve these challenges using our knowledge to ensure the optimal operation of the intended network.

One of the most important and challenging parts of the project is the investigation of the N1-Contingency or Single Contingency criterion. We aim to analyze this criterion for the target network and examine its implications.
